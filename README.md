<div>

<p align= justify>
Welcome to this macOS custom keyboard bundle repository! As of now, this bundle features a single keyboard layout designed explicitly for Math enthusiasts, educators, researchers, or anyone who often finds themselves typing mathematical symbols and equations in raw text.
</p>

<h4 style="">Why This Keyboard?</h4>
<div align= justify>

Like many of you, I found it frustrating to sift through the Unicode symbol viewer or to remember complex shortcuts just to insert a math symbol. The idea behind this project is to streamline that process. This custom keyboard, designed using [Ukelele](#Ukelele-documentation-placeholder), includes a comprehensive set of lower-case Greek letters, upper-case Greek letters (accessible with `Shift`), and a range of commonly used mathematical symbols. For miscellaneous but useful symbols, use `Command + Shift`.

</div>

<h4 style="">How to Use</h4>
<div align= justify>

Once you've installed the bundle ([Installation Section](#installation)), an easy way to familiarize yourself with the layout is to go to the keyboard symbol in the right-side of the menu bar (should look like a box with an `A`). From there, click "Show Keyboard Viewer." As you hold down the `Shift` and `Command + Shift` keys, the Keyboard Viewer will display the available symbols, making it incredibly straightforward to see what each key will produce. Personally, I like to keep this viewer open when working on a math-heavy text file.

</div>

 <h4 style="">Future Developments</h4>
 <div align= justify>

While I currently have no immediate plans to expand this bundle beyond the Math keyboard, I am open to suggestions or collaborations for additional layouts. Feel free to get in touch if you have specific needs or ideas! If you're inclined to DIY, you can use [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) to modify the existing layouts or create your own from scratch.

Thank you for stopping by, and happy typing!
